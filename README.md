# EE316-Project2
Project 2 (Pulse Width Modulator) for class EE 316
# File Structure
All testbench code for the project is contained in the Test_VHDL_Code folder.
The vhdl files for the final product is contained in Final_Product foler.
# Using the Repository
To use the VHDL files create a new project in Quartus II and add all VHDL files in the
Final_Product folder. Then use the Mega-Wizard tool to create a one-port ROM and use the sine.mif file to initialize the contents of the ROM. Then compile the project and program the Altera DE2 FPGA.
